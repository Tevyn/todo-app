# Product Requirements Document: Todo List Application

## Introduction/Overview

This document outlines the requirements for building a personal todo list application that provides comprehensive task management capabilities. The application will serve as a single-user productivity tool that allows for hierarchical task organization, flexible categorization through tags, and persistent data storage. The solution addresses the need for a clean, responsive interface that supports complex task relationships while maintaining simplicity in design and user experience.

**Goal:** Create a fully-featured, responsive todo list application with drag-and-drop reordering, hierarchical sub-tasks, tagging system, and multiple list management capabilities.

## Goals

1. **Task Management**: Provide comprehensive task creation, editing, and completion tracking
2. **Hierarchical Organization**: Enable one-level sub-task relationships with automatic parent completion
3. **Flexible Categorization**: Implement a dynamic tagging system with color coding and filtering
4. **Multiple Lists**: Support separate, independent todo lists for different contexts
5. **Intuitive Interaction**: Deliver drag-and-drop reordering and responsive design
6. **Data Persistence**: Ensure all data persists between sessions through database storage
7. **Clean UI**: Utilize shadcn components for a modern, consistent interface

## User Stories

**As a user, I want to:**

1. **Create and manage tasks** so that I can track my responsibilities
   - Create new todos with title, description, and due date
   - Edit existing todos
   - Mark todos as complete/incomplete
   - Delete todos when no longer needed

2. **Organize tasks hierarchically** so that I can break down complex work
   - Add sub-todos to any main todo
   - Have parent todos automatically complete when all sub-todos are done
   - View the relationship between parent and child tasks clearly

3. **Categorize with tags** so that I can organize tasks by context
   - Create tags on-the-fly while editing todos
   - Assign multiple tags to any todo
   - Filter todos by selecting from existing tags
   - Visually distinguish tags with automatically assigned colors
   - Customize tag colors from available options

4. **Reorder tasks intuitively** so that I can prioritize effectively
   - Drag and drop todos to reorder them within a list
   - Maintain custom ordering across sessions

5. **Manage multiple lists** so that I can separate different areas of my life
   - Create multiple independent todo lists
   - Switch between lists easily
   - Keep lists completely separate

6. **Track due dates visually** so that I can manage deadlines
   - Set due dates on todos
   - See visual indicators for overdue items
   - Identify upcoming deadlines at a glance

7. **Access from any device** so that I can manage tasks anywhere
   - Use the application on desktop, tablet, and mobile
   - Have consistent functionality across all screen sizes

## Functional Requirements

### Core Task Management
1. The system must allow users to create new todos with title, description, and due date fields
2. The system must allow users to edit all todo properties after creation
3. The system must allow users to mark todos as complete or incomplete
4. The system must allow users to delete todos and their associated sub-todos
5. The system must display todos in a clear, readable list format
6. The system must persist all todo data in a database between sessions

### Sub-Task Functionality
7. The system must allow users to add sub-todos to any main todo (one level only)
8. The system must automatically mark a parent todo as complete when all its sub-todos are completed
9. The system must automatically mark a parent todo as incomplete if any sub-todo becomes incomplete
10. The system must visually indicate the hierarchical relationship between parent and sub-todos
11. The system must allow independent completion of sub-todos

### Drag and Drop Reordering
12. The system must allow users to drag and drop todos to reorder them within a list
13. The system must maintain custom ordering across browser sessions
14. The system must provide visual feedback during drag operations
15. The system must support reordering of both parent todos and sub-todos independently

### Tagging System
16. The system must allow users to create new tags while editing todos
17. The system must allow users to assign multiple tags to any todo
18. The system must display tags with color coding for visual distinction
19. The system must provide filtering functionality through a selectable list of existing tags
20. The system must automatically assign colors to tags from a predefined color palette
21. The system must allow users to change tag colors from available color options
22. The system must persist all tag data and associations

### Multiple Lists
23. The system must allow users to create multiple independent todo lists
24. The system must provide easy navigation between different lists
25. The system must keep all lists completely separate (no cross-list functionality)
26. The system must allow users to name and rename lists

### Due Date Management
27. The system must allow users to set due dates on todos
28. The system must provide visual indicators for overdue todos
29. The system must display due dates in a clear, readable format
30. The system must sort or highlight todos approaching their due dates

### User Interface
31. The system must use shadcn components as the primary UI framework
32. The system must be fully responsive across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
33. The system must maintain consistent styling and user experience
34. The system must minimize the use of custom components in favor of shadcn components

### Technical Infrastructure
35. The system must use Node.js/npm for all development and runtime dependencies
36. The system must store all data in a database for persistence
37. The system must not require user authentication (single-user application)

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **Multi-user functionality**: No user accounts, authentication, or sharing capabilities
2. **Deep nesting**: Sub-todos cannot have their own sub-todos (maximum one level of hierarchy)
3. **Cross-list operations**: No ability to move todos between different lists
4. **Import/Export**: No data import or export functionality
5. **Search functionality**: No search or advanced filtering beyond tag filtering
6. **Notifications**: No push notifications, email alerts, or system notifications
7. **Collaboration features**: No sharing, commenting, or assignment capabilities
8. **Advanced scheduling**: No recurring tasks, calendar integration, or time-based automation
9. **Offline functionality**: No offline support or sync capabilities

## Design Considerations

- **Component Library**: Primary use of shadcn/ui components for consistency and reduced development time
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach ensuring usability across all device sizes
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Clear distinction between parent todos and sub-todos through indentation and styling
- **Color System**: Consistent color coding for tags that integrates with the overall theme
- **Drag Indicators**: Clear visual feedback during drag-and-drop operations
- **State Management**: Efficient handling of complex state relationships (parent-child todo completion)

## Technical Considerations

- **Stack**: Node.js/npm ecosystem for all dependencies and tooling
- **Database**: Selection of appropriate database solution for single-user data persistence
- **State Management**: Consideration for managing complex relationships between todos and sub-todos
- **Performance**: Efficient rendering for large lists with drag-and-drop capabilities
- **Data Validation**: Client-side and server-side validation for all user inputs

## Success Metrics

1. **Functionality Completeness**: All 37 functional requirements are implemented and working
2. **User Experience**: Application is intuitive and requires no learning curve for basic operations
3. **Performance**: Drag-and-drop operations are smooth and responsive
4. **Reliability**: Data persistence works consistently with no data loss
5. **Responsiveness**: Application works seamlessly across all target device sizes
6. **Code Quality**: Minimal custom components with maximum reuse of shadcn components

## Open Questions

1. **Database Choice**: What specific database technology should be used for optimal single-user performance?
2. **State Management**: Should a state management library be used, or is React's built-in state sufficient?
3. **Backend Architecture**: What backend framework would integrate best with the Node.js requirement?
